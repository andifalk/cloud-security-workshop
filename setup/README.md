# Setup

## Import the workshop project into your IDE

1. Clone the git repository https://github.com/andifalk/cloud-security-workshop or download it as zip file
2. Import the whole directory into your Java IDE as __Maven__ project
   * IntelliJ: File/New/Project from existing sources -> Select directory -> Select __Maven__ in next step
   * Eclipse: File/Import -> Select '__Maven__'/'__Existing Maven Projects__' -> Select directory -> Click 'Finish'
   * Visual Studio Code: Just open the directory with VS Code -> VS Code should automatically configure the project
3. You might have to explicitly trigger an update for the maven configuration to load dependencies (depending on your IDE)
